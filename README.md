# My scRNA-seq Analysis Package

This package provides functions for processing single-cell RNA-seq data, training logistic regression models, and post-processing the model outputs.

The unique architecture of this package uses a non low-dimensional latent representation of single cell data, which captures non-linear cell relationships. It trains a Bayesian-optimized ElasticNet regressor which effectively provides probabilistic relationships between a set of training and query data and labels.

## Installation

You can install this package by cloning the GitHub repository and running `python setup.py install`.

## Usage

The main parts of the package are the data processing, modeling, and post-processing modules. Here's a basic example of how to use the package:

```python
from my_package import data_processing, modeling, post_processing, feature_estimator

# Load and preprocess the data
data = data_processing.load_data('my_data.csv')
preprocessed_data = data_processing.preprocess_data(data)

# Train the model
model = modeling.train_model(preprocessed_data)

# Use the model to make predictions
predictions = modeling.make_predictions(model, preprocessed_data)

# Post-process the predictions
processed_predictions = post_processing.process_predictions(predictions)
```

Please note that this is a high-level example and the actual usage will depend on your specific data and requirements.
