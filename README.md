# low_dimensional_logistic_regression_label_learning
This repository contains a prototype classifier developed for mapping large sc-multiomic datasets using pre-integrated low-dimensional latent embeddings as input. If given input is linear, a weighted score for feature importance of predicted classes may be derived. Else, we can estimate this using a bayesian DE approach.
