# Multimodal_Probabillistic_Ensemble_Transfer_Learning framework
This repository contains code and utils for learning methods which focus on leveraging intergrative latent encodings learnt from dimensionality reduction techniques. 
-   Leverage score sampling
-   KNN bayesian sampling
-   GNN learning
-   Empirical bayesian frameworks are leveraged for quality control
-   Label quality harmonisation (weighted R2 and F1)

## 1: low_dimensional_logistic_regression_learning_probabillistic_transfer
This repository contains a prototype classifier developed for mapping large sc-multiomic datasets using pre-integrated low-dimensional latent embeddings as input. If given input is linear, a weighted score for feature importance of predicted classes may be derived. Else, we can estimate this using a bayesian DE approach.
